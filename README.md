## My Portfolio site

A _Middleman_ project to show off my development endeavours to date.

In this project I have used _Rspec_ with _Capybara_ for acceptance tests, which
_Rspec_ doesn't really know how to do. Or at least to my opinion it is pointless.
But perhaps I misunderstood something.   

The _html_ parts are written in _haml_.

The _css_ are mostly written in _scss_.

For styling I have used _a free template_.
